                    <p> Hey there, I'm Myles Stubbs, a recent Computer Science graduate from Massey University living in Auckland, New Zealand. I have loved all things nature
                        and tech since I was young. As you may see further down, I originally did a double major in Ecology and Zoology after leaving Highschool.
                        Due to the uncertainty of the Covid outbreak, jobs were few and far between when graduating. Fast forward a little bit and I decided 
                        that I may be better off pursuing my passion for tech, seeing me at Uni again to complete yet another BcS in Computer Science. With all I have 
                        learnt and recent advancements in tech I am excited to see where it can take me - who knows, maybe it will lead down a path where I get to combine
                        my two main passions!
